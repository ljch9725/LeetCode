657.Â Judge Route Circle

##### Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to **the original place**. 

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are `R` (Right), `L`(Left), `U` (Up) and `D` (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "LL"
Output: false
```

#####  Solution:

```swift
class Solution {
    func judgeCircle(_ moves: String) -> Bool {
        var xMoves = 0
	    var yMoves = 0
	
	    moves.characters.forEach { move in
            switch move {
            case "R":
                xMoves += 1
            case "L":
                xMoves -= 1
            case "U":
                yMoves += 1
            case "D":
                yMoves -= 1
            default:
                break
            }
	    }
	
	return xMoves == 0 && yMoves == 0
    }
}
```
