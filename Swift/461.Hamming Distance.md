461. Hamming Distance

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**
0 ≤ `x`, `y` < 231.

**Example:**

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

##### Solution:

```swift
class Solution {
    func hammingDistance(_ x: Int, _ y: Int) -> Int {
        var num = x ^ y
        var hamDis = 0
        while num != 0{
            hamDis += num & 1
            num = num >> 1
        }
        return hamDis
    }
}
```
